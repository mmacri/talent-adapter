3. **Variant Optimization**: Create new variants based on performance data
4. **Document Export**: Generate Word documents for new applications
5. **Performance Analysis**: Regular review of reports for optimization opportunities

### Interaction Design Patterns

#### Progressive Enhancement
- **Basic Functionality**: Core features work without JavaScript
- **Enhanced Experience**: Rich interactions with full JS enabled
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading and code splitting

#### Consistent Interface Elements
- **Action Buttons**: Primary (create/save), Secondary (edit/view), Destructive (delete)
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded badges for application statuses
- **Data Visualization**: Consistent chart styling and interaction patterns
- **Form Patterns**: Standardized input layouts and validation

#### Accessibility Considerations
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full functionality accessible via keyboard
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliant color combinations
- **Focus Management**: Clear visual focus indicators

## Technical Design Decisions

### Architecture Choices

#### Frontend Framework: React + TypeScript
**Rationale**: 
- Component-based architecture enables reusable UI elements
- TypeScript provides type safety for complex data relationships
- Large ecosystem with mature tooling and libraries
- Strong performance characteristics for data-heavy applications

#### State Management: React Context + Local Storage
**Rationale**:
- Context provides centralized state without external dependencies
- Local storage ensures data persistence across sessions
- Simpler than Redux for application scope and complexity
- Easy to extend with additional contexts if needed

#### Styling: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui
**Rationale**:
- Utility-first approach enables rapid UI development
- Consistent design system through semantic tokens
- Pre-built accessible components from shadcn/ui
- Easy customization through CSS custom properties

#### Build Tool: Vite
**Rationale**:
- Fast development server with hot module replacement
- Optimized production builds with code splitting
- Modern JavaScript features with broad browser support
- Excellent TypeScript integration

### Data Model Design

#### Normalized Data Structure
```typescript
// Separate entities with relationships via IDs
MasterResume → (1:many) → Variants
JobApplication → (many:1) → Variant
JobApplication → (many:1) → CoverLetter
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents data duplication
- Maintains referential integrity
- Enables efficient querying and filtering
- Supports complex analytics calculations

#### Flexible Schema Design
- **Tagged Content**: Experience entries support multiple tags for flexible filtering
- **Override System**: Path-based modifications for granular variant control  
- **Extensible Fields**: Easy addition of new properties without breaking changes
- **Version Tracking**: Timestamps for all entities enable change tracking

### Performance Considerations

#### Client-Side Optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Route-based chunks reduce initial bundle size
- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on demand
- **Memoization**: Expensive calculations cached with useMemo/useCallback
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Large lists rendered efficiently

#### Data Optimization
- **Local Storage**: Eliminates network requests for CRUD operations
- **Computed Properties**: Derived data calculated client-side
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Optimized filtering and sorting implementations
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Strategic component optimization

## Security & Privacy Design

### Data Protection
- **Local Storage Only**: No server-side data storage eliminates privacy concerns
- **No Authentication Required**: Eliminates account security vulnerabilities  
- **Export Control**: Users control all data export and sharing
- **No Tracking**: Application doesn't collect analytics or user behavior data

### Input Validation
- **TypeScript Interfaces**: Compile-time type checking
- **Form Validation**: Runtime validation with Zod schemas
- **Sanitization**: Safe HTML rendering in rich text components
- **XSS Prevention**: Proper escaping of user-generated content

## Scalability & Extensibility

### Feature Extensibility
- **Plugin Architecture**: New rule types can be added to variant resolver
- **Component Library**: UI components designed for reuse and extension
- **Hook Patterns**: Custom hooks encapsulate complex logic for reuse
- **Event System**: Context methods enable easy feature integration

### Data Scalability
- **Efficient Storage**: Optimized data structures minimize storage overhead
- **Indexing Strategy**: Tagged content enables fast filtering
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple items processed efficiently
- **Migration Support**: Version tracking enables future schema changes

### Integration Capabilities
- **Export Formats**: Multiple output formats (DOCX, text, potentially PDF)
- **Import Support**: Structured for potential LinkedIn/other platform imports
- **API Ready**: Data models structured for future API integration
- **Third-party Tools**: Export formats compatible with ATS systems

## Quality Assurance Strategy

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Compile-time error detection
- **ESLint Configuration**: Consistent code style and best practices
- **Component Testing**: Isolated testing of UI components
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end user workflow validation

### User Experience Quality
